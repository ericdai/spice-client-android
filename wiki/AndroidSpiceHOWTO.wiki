#Introductions to port spice-client onto android

= Introduction =
  This port is based on the spice-gtk-0.5 with which as the data layer along with the  UI layer rewritten in Java. It's released under LGPL, welcome to use and improve!
  
= How to build =
(cmdline way,Eclipse way may diff)
#.prepare and port the prerequisites: glib-2.28.1,pixman-0.20.0,jpeg-6b and openssl-1.0.0 onto android(see the section "Prerequisites" below)
#.download the source here and create the android project.
#.
*$android update project
 to build libspicec.so,in commandline,use 
*$ndk-build 
 then build the SDK project
*$ant debug
 
*If your want to use the built androidspice to connect your VM,you should also force JPEG compression in Spice-server.(see section "Details")

= Prerequisites =
  Too many,so I build them statically into libspicec.so(you may check this in Android.mk files in project)
  The introductions of porting them along with all the tools,patches,and steps,can be found in my blogs about spice-snappy porting:

  or your may check my mails (shohyanglim@gmail.com)in spice-dev-list,if none,mail to me,please!

= Details =
  The damned greatest obstacle I've faced in the porting lies in the structure of Android:It has no(at least for version<2.3 ) exposed audio/image output and input API for C(only Java!)! So I have to transport all the fixed data got from spice-server to Java layer by adding two new threads to handle the I/O communication with Java UI via two UNIX-sockets,that's the leg-drawing of speed. Besides, quic.c in client is buggy of SIGBUS or SIGSEGV on android(no time to rewrite it now),I have no better way but to force use of JPEG compression in server and send jpeg data directly to Java UI for output, it's queer and should be condemned('cause Spice's value is in the Image processing ability),
So now It just WORKS,but works badly, the first bug is this

 *bug 1:If press fast on the device the spice-server as well as the android-spice-client will be choked and no image updates will be sent out from server. I'm still working on this bug,I need help!
